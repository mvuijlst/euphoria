# The Kingdom of Euphoria

Imagine that you are the king of the ancient European Kingdom of Euphoria. Each year your loyal ministers report to you on the state of your holdings, and you are responsible for the welfare of your peasants, to give them grain to eat, protect them from the ravages of war, etc. And of course, you want to increase your wealth and influence.

As a game, this program does not need much introduction. It is an ideal pastime to keep the kids busy, since the rules are simple. It is not particularly easy to get rich in this game, however, so you might find it challenging yourself.

The hardest thing about this program is figuring out how much to feed the peasants, plant, or keep. I recommend playing once or twice with no other objective than to find out what the parameters are. Then you will not be so disappointed when three quarters of your population dies off from starvation. After that you can get down to developing a serious strategy.

This game has been around in various versions for a long time. This one is neither original with me, nor particularly well-designed. I only translated it into python. It is, however, interesting to play for a while, and it has been known to keep kids (and some adults!) busy for hours.
